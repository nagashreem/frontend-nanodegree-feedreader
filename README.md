## Overview

For this project, the Javascript testing framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is used to write a number of tests against a pre-existing web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## Files

The Project repository includes css, fonts, jasmine and js folders, as well as an index.html and a README.md file. 

- The css folder contains three .css files.
- The jasmine folder contains jasmine 2.1.2 library files as well as the spec file feedreader.js
- The js folder contains the app.js
- index.html - opening index.html should load the game
- README.md should contain instructions on how to load and play the game.

## Instructions?

Open index.html in a web browser and you will see the Feed Reader. At the bottom of the Feed Reader page, the Jasmine framework output will display 7 test specs as passing, with 0 failures.

For details about the tests and their implementation, review the feedreader.js file. This spec file consists of the test suites which will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
